Android Audio Streaming Hearing Aid Peripheral Sample Code
==========================================================

NOTE: If you use this sample application for your own purposes, follow
      the licensing agreement specified in `Software_Use_Agreement.rtf`
      in the home directory of the installed RSL10 Software
      Development Kit (SDK).

Overview
========
This sample project demonstrates the use of the RSL10 Bluetooth Low Energy 
library to develop an audio streaming application for the Audio Streaming for 
Hearing Aids profile ([ASHA][ASHA_link]). The application establishes two audio links 
and streams stereo audio data from the Android device to two hearing aids (left
 and right hearing aids).

[ASHA_link]: https://source.android.com/devices/bluetooth/asha
 
Depending on the device address type selected by the application (in app.h), 
either a public or private address is used for the hearing aid.

An Android device can scan, connect, pair/bond to the hearing aid and perform 
service discovery. It displays the name of the discovered hearing aid (which is
set by default to `ble_android_asha`). This sample project also generates the 
Device Information Service and the Battery Service.

The side of the ASHA profile is selected by the `ASHA_CAPABILITIES_SIDE` 
preprocessor symbol. Four preset build configurations support Debug and Release
builds for the left and right channels.

The user then can start streaming audio from the Android device to the two 
connected hearing aids using a streaming applications (e.g., YouTube(TM) or 
Netflix(TM)). The user can pause, restart or adjust the volume of the audio 
stream.

This sample project is equipped with a Bluetooth low energy abstraction layer
that provides a higher level application programming interface (API) to 
abstract the Bluetooth GAP, GATT and L2C layers. The abstraction layer has been
designed to improve flexibility and simplicity by providing the following 
features:
  - An event subscription mechanism that allows the application to subscribe 
  and receive callback notifications for any Kernel or Bluetooth event. This 
  improves encapsulation/integration of different modules, as they can be 
  implemented while isolated in their own files.
  - Generic definition of custom services with callback notification support
  - Security handling and bond list implementation in RSL10 flash
  - Code structure and API naming aligned with RivieraWaves documentation, so
    you can map the code into the documentation more easily

The sample code was refactored to keep the generic abstraction layer code
and application-specific code in separate files. This increases flexibility,
maintainability and reusability of components between distinct applications.

After the connection is established, for any profiles/services that need to
be enabled, an enable request message is sent to the corresponding profile of
the Bluetooth stack. Once a response is received for each of those profiles,
the application starts advertising.

Battery Service: this service database is configured for a single battery
                 instance. A second battery can be added by modifying the
                 `APP_BAS_NB` definition in `app_bass.h`. The application 
                 provides a callback function to read the battery level using 
                 the average of 16 reads of the RSL10 ADC.

The application notifies clients about the battery level when it changes: the 
application monitors the level periodically and sends a notification when a 
change is detected. The monitoring timeout is configured using the
`BASS_NotifyOnBattLevelChange()` function.

The message subscription mechanism allows the application and services to
subscribe and receive callback notifications based on the Kernel message ID
or task ID. This allows each module of the application to be independently
implemented in its own files. The subscription is performed using the
`MsgHandler_Add()` function. The application subscribes to receive GAPM and
GAPC events (see `app.c`). The services subscribe to receive Kernel events in
their initialization function (see `BASS_Initialize()` in `ble_bass.c`, for an
example). The application event handlers are implemented in `app_msg_handler.c`.

The basic sequence of operations and event messages exchanged between the
application and the Bluetooth stack is presented below:

    APP <--> Bluetooth low energy Stack

        --->  GAPM_ResetCmd() - app.c
        <---  GAPM_CMP_EVT / GAPM_RESET

Android ASHA Service
==========================
The ASHA service is implemented through a custom service (UUID `0xFDF0`) with 
the following characteristics:

```
| Characteristic      |           UUID                       |
|---------------------|:------------------------------------:|
| ReadOnlyProperties  | 6333651e-c481-4a3e-9169-7c902aad37bb |
| AudioControlPoint   | f0d4de7e-4a88-476c-9d9f-1937b0996cc0 |
| AudioStatusPoint    | 38663f1a-e711-4cac-b641-326b56404837 |
| Volume              | 00e4ca9e-ab14-41e4-8823-f9e70c7e91df |
| LE_PSM              | 2d410339-82b6-42aa-b34e-e2e01df8cc1a |
```

Register a callback function through the `ASHA_Initialize()` function. This 
callback function is called for different events that require processing by 
the application code.  The callback's function first argument specifies the 
event, and the second argument holds the parameter for the event.

  - `ASHA_Operation_volumeChange`. This event is activated when the phone 
  requires a volume change, either increasing or decreasing. The parameter 
  contains the new volume setting.
  - `ASHA_Operation_audioStart`. This event is activated when the phone writes
  to the `AudioControlPoint` characteristic indicating that the audio stream 
  transmission is starting. The ASHA specification requires the phone to write
  to the `AudioControlPoint` characteristic whenever it starts or stops 
  streaming. The Bluetooth Low Energy abstraction creates different events for
  the audio start and stop.
  - `ASHA_Operation_audioStop`. This event is activated when the phone writes 
  to the `AudioControlPoint` characteristic indicating that the audio stream 
  transmission was stopped. The ASHA specification requires the phone to write
  to the `AudioControlPoint` characteristic whenever it starts or stops 
  streaming. The Bluetooth Low Energy abstraction creates different events for
  the audio start and stop.
  - `ASHA_Operation_audioRcvd`. This event is activated when an audio streaming
  packet is received. The application code has to then handle queuing and 
  rendering of the audio data.

The ASHA service uses an L2CAP credit-based connection to perform flow control.
Typically an application adds credits to the connection when it has finished 
rendering an audio sample and thus has freed a buffer or queue position. The 
Bluetooth Low Energy abstraction offers the `ASHA_AddCredits()` function to 
help handle this.

Source Code Organization
==========================  

This sample project is structured as follows:
The source code exists in a "source" folder. Application-related header files
are in the "include" folder. The `main()` function is implemented in the `app.c`
file, which is located in the parent directory.

The Bluetooth low energy abstraction layer is placed in two separate folders:
`ble` and `ble_profiles`. The `ble` folder contains support functions for the
GAP and GATT layers. It also has a message handling mechanism that allows the
application to subscribe to Kernel events. The `ble_profiles` folder contains
standard profiles-related files.

The device address type and source are set in app.h. If `APP_DEVICE_PARAM_SRC`
is set to `FLASH_PROVIDED_or_DFLT` and the address type is set to
`GAPM_CFG_ADDR_PUBLIC`, the stack loads the public device address stored in NVR3
flash. Otherwise, the address provided in the application is used.

Hardware Requirements
=====================
This application can be configured to run on two different hardware setups. The
first setup is a RSL10 Evaluation and Development Board and an Ezairo 7100
Evaluation and Development Board as the audio renderer. The second supported 
setup is the Ezairo 7160SL Hybrid Demonstrator Board.

RSL10 and Ezairo 7100
---------------------
To support this configuration, the project must be compiled with the 
`EZAIRO_71XX_DIO_CFG` preprocessor symbol set to `7100`. This configuration uses 
the following pin connections between the RSL10 and Ezairo 7100 boards:

```
| Pin Signal                  |        RSL10        |         Ezairo 7100       |
|-----------------------------|:-------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| SPI Chip Select             | (CS_DO)       DIO0  | (DIO_C_SPI_CS)      DIO25 |
| SPI MOSI                    | (SER_DO)      DIO1  | (DIO_C_SPI_SERI)    DIO26 |
| SPI MISO                    | (SER_DI)      DIO2  | (DIO_C_SPI_SERO)    DIO23 |
| SPI Clock                   | (CLK_DO)      DIO3  | (DIO_C_SPI_CLK)     DIO24 |
| Sampling Frequency Clock    | (SAMPL_CLK)   DIO13 | (DIO_MCLK)          DIO21 |
| RF Interrupt                | (RF_INT)      DIO14 | (DIO_RX_IRQ)        DIO16 |
| VDDO                        |         VDDO        |             VDDO3         |
| Ground                      |         GND         |             GND           |
```

In this configuration, the RSL10 is the SPI Master and the Ezairo 7100 is the
SPI Slave.

In addition to the above pin connection diagram, note the following when setting
up the hardware configurations:
  - Connection cables between the two boards should be as short as possible.
  - On RSL10 Evaluation and Development Boards: ensure that no jumpers are
    placed on P9 (since VDDO is being externally supplied).
  - On Ezairo 7100 Evaluation and Development Boards: ensure that a jumper
    is placed on VBATOD-EN, and jumpers are placed on pins 1 and 2 of
    `VDDO2_SEL` and `VDDO3_SEL`. The `FILTEN0` jumpers must be closed 
    (1-2 and 3-4).

Ezairo 7160
---------------------
To support this configuration, the project must be compiled with 
`EZAIRO_71XX_DIO_CFG` preprocessor symbol set to 7160. The pins used in this 
configuration are as follows:

```
| Pin Signal                  |        RSL10        |         Ezairo 7100       |
|-----------------------------|:-------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| SPI Chip Select             | (CS_DO)       DIO0  | (DIO_C_SPI_CS)      DIO11 |
| SPI MOSI                    | (SER_DO)      DIO1  | (DIO_C_SPI_SERI)    DIO12 |
| SPI MISO                    | (SER_DI)      DIO14 | (DIO_C_SPI_SERO)    DIO18 |
| SPI Clock                   | (CLK_DO)      DIO3  | (DIO_C_SPI_CLK)     DIO14 |
| Sampling Frequency Clock    | (SAMPL_CLK)   DIO2  | (DIO_MCLK)          DIO13 |
| RF Interrupt                | (RF_INT)      DIO9  | (DIO_RX_IRQ)        DIO15 |
| VDDO                        |         VDDO        |             VDDO3         |
| Ground                      |         GND         |             GND           |
```

Please also change the `defines` below to the presented values in `app.cfi` of 
the `audio_spi_slave` Ezairo application (see the Verification below):

    #define DIO_C_SPI_CLK 14
    #define DIO_C_SPI_CS 11
    #define DIO_C_SPI_SERI 12
    #define DIO_C_SPI_SERO 18
    #define DIO_MCLK 13
    #define DIO_RX_IRQ 15

Importing a Project
===================
To import the sample code into your IDE workspace, refer to the
Getting Started Guide for your IDE for more information.

Select the project configuration according to the required optimization level.
Use "Debug" configuration for optimization level "None" or "Release"
configuration for optimization level "More" or "O2". The Debug and Release
configurations will set `ASHA_CAPABILITIES_SIDE` preprocessor symbol to 
`ASHA_CAPABILITIES_SIDE_LEFT`. This compiles the sample application as a left
audio channel hearing aid. To support the right audio channel, please use the 
`Debug_Right` and `Release_Right` build configurations.

Verification
============
To verify if this application is functioning correctly, use an RSL10 Evaluation
and Development Board combined with an audio renderer as a hearing aid (a pair
of hearing aids is required) and an Android phone device. The hearing aid feature
should be enabled on the phone. At the time of writing this instruction, no
Android phone has this feature by default. The user needs to download the
Android source code (aosp master branch), enable the feature, recompile it and
load the custom generated ROM on the Android phone. [This link][config_xml] has
the required changes in the Android source code. The feature has been 
successfully tested with Android 9.0 r16 (build PQ1A.181105.017.A1) on a Pixel 
2 (walleye) as well as a Pixel 2 XL (taimen) phones.

[config_xml]: https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/packages/apps/Bluetooth/+/736737/1/res/values/config.xml

This sample code needs to be compiled and flashed onto the RSL10 Evaluation and
Development Boards. If Ezairo 7100 or 7160 Evaluation and Development Boards 
are used as the audio renderer, each board must be programmed with the 
`audio_spi_slave` application (required to process the transmitted data from 
RSL10) that is provided in the utility applications folder (obtained by 
extracting the `RSL10_Utility_Apps.zip` file). Make sure to set the MFI_APP 
definition to 1 in `app.cfi`.

Initially the hearing aids need to be manually paitred with the Android device. 
After this first pairing, the Android device detects the hearing aids and 
automatically connects to them. The audio signal in the Android device can be 
streamed to the hearing aids and perceived by the user.

Each time a valid audio packet is received from the Android device, DIO11 pins on
the RSL10 Evaluation and Development Boards are toggled.

When using Ezairo 7100 Evaluation and Development Boards as described above, 
the audio output can be monitored through the first RCA output channel (RCVR0 -
with FILTEN0 pins 1-2 and 3-4 connected). The left and right audio packet delay
can be measured by comparing SPI Chip Select pins on the two Ezairo 7100 
Evaluation and Development Boards.

Notes
=====
Sometimes the firmware in RSL10 cannot be successfully re-flashed, due to the
application going into Sleep Mode or resetting continuously (either by design
or due to a programming error). To circumvent this scenario, a software 
recovery mode using DIO12 can be implemented with the following steps:

1.  Connect DIO12 to ground.
2.  Press the RESET button (this restarts the application, which will
    pause at the start of its initialization routine).
3.  Re-flash RSL10. After successful re-flashing, disconnect DIO12 from
    ground, and press the RESET button so that the application will work
    properly.
